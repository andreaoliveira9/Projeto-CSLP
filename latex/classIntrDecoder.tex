Class for implementing intra decoding.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$intra\+Coding.\+hpp$>$}



\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Class for implementing intra decoding. 

This class uses transform coding techniques to efficiently decode video frames. It supports efficient decoding of video frames by considering spatial redundancies. It also uses Golomb codes for entropy coding. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
