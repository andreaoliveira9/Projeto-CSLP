## How to run

### Before running the programs, you need to install the following library:

- OpenCV

  _To install it, you need to run the following command:_

  ```
  sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
  ```

### To run each of the programs, you need to specify the program name on CMakeLists.txt file, and then run the following commands:

```makefile
target_link_libraries(VideoPlayer ${OpenCV_LIBS} )
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.17)
project( ProjetoCSLP )
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )
include_directories( ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
set(SOURCES
  hybridEncodeTest.cpp # For this deliverable use this files (hybridDecodeTest.cpp, hybridEncodeTest.cpp, instraEncodeTest.cpp, intraDecodeTest.cpp)
)
add_executable( ${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES})
target_link_libraries( ${PROJECT_NAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS} )
```

### Then, you need to run the following commands:

_You need to be in the src directory of the project_

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### After that, you can run the program by running the following command:

```
./ProjetoCSLP
```
